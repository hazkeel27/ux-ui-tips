## Description 📄

A full-stack application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. Users can save and get suggestions for clever UX/UI design and feedback with this application, which effectively uses the GET and POST methods of the Fetch API to enable data interaction. It displays a comprehensive and thorough approach to user interaction and data management by methodically storing these insights in distinct JSON files and elegantly addressing incorrect entries by funneling them into a designated "diagnostics" file.
